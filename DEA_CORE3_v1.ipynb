clean car, actual mileage. 6 speed. Paint is good and original, car is clean. Mileage is actual. Garage kept, never winter driven. Borla exhaust ( I think ).  Your looking at pics of the car taken on 4/9/21, car is not being driven, and has NOT been washed or detailed for the photos, if you want to see it, this is exactly how you will find it, as shown in the pics.  This person that drove this car can no longer operate it, so its for sale.  Where not doing scams, and BS and the like, so if your not paying with hard currency, or a bank wire before pickup, waste someone else's time please.  Please ask questions.
